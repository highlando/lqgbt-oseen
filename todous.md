cur work: find an sdre setup that is feasible
cur idea: cylwake with dim 1 and dist cont
last step: added func to dou to compute `|y-y*|**2`
next step: use it to see performance

IMPLEMENTING
---

 * SDRE Feedback!! for checking whether SDC helps at all

PLAN FOR NUMTESTS
---

TODOUS:
---
 * pymess integration
   * check pymessvsmymess.py
   * -- why does the control gramian converge so badly???
