LQG-BT for linearized Navier-Stokes Equations
---------------------------------------------

Python module for application of LQG-balanced truncation for low-order controllers for the stabilization of Navier-Stokes

As an example we consider the stabilization of the cylinder wake at moderate Reynoldsnumbers via distributed control and observation.
